# threading.local is used instead of storing the session on self because
# hass-kumo dispatches pykumo calls via HA's shared ThreadPoolExecutor
# (async_add_executor_job), meaning the same PyKumo instance can land on
# different threads across successive calls. requests.Session is not
# thread-safe, so a per-thread store is required.
_tl = threading.local()


# Process-wide, per-adapter gates. Thread-local sessions alone do not bound
# the number of connections to an adapter: HA's executor can run a poll and
# one or more commands (or two polls) for the same unit on different threads
# at once, each with its own session and socket. The adapters have very few
# socket slots and little memory, so all traffic to a given address goes
# through one gate, which:
# - serializes it: at most one in-flight request (and one TCP connection)
#   per adapter per process;
# - queues waiting threads first-come-first-served, so a command issued
#   during a poll runs right after it rather than at an arbitrary point;
# - spaces requests out so the adapter gets a minimum idle gap between the
#   end of one request and the start of the next.
# The gate is reentrant so that requests nested inside a cycle on the same
# thread (e.g. do_reboot() or schedule fetch() during update_status()) don't
# deadlock.
